## Data Engineering Capstone

### **Project scope:**
This project is about modelling and preparing data about immigration to US. 
The model will facilitate analytics around this data to figure out 
where the immigrants come frome why. Also which are the most used airports for 
immigration. 
### **Datasets:**
The following are the datasets used in this project:
 - I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. We will use data for year 2016. The files are divided into 12 file (file per month).
 - World Temperature Data: This dataset is about the average temprature per city per country.

 - U.S. City Demographic Data: This dataset contains information about the demographics of all US cities and census-designated places with a population greater or equal to 65,000.

 - Airport Code Table: This is a lookup for the airports around the world and itsrelated informaiton (name,codelocation,coordinates,... etc).

 - Country GDP annual growth: This dataset countains the GDP per country since1960 till 2020.
